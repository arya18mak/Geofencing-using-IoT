We created a wearable consumer electronic band to geofence Covid-19 patients aiming to mitigate exposure risk, allow continuos monitoring and optimize staff allocation in a hospital/quarantine centres. We used signals from k-nearest  Wifi-routers/Beacons (minimum 3) and depending on their strength i.e. RSSI values our RandomForestClassifier model classified whether the person/entity is within the boundaries or not and the Linear regressor pointed out the coordinates on the area's map. Real-time notfications were sent to the hospital staff if band was tampered/fence was violated.
